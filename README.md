Conway's Game of life is a cellular automaton that operates based on following rules:

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
  
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

This application is tend to implements a comprehensive version of this game so that you can generate the respective representation of the cellular automaton for
a particular iteration based on the initialized state.

## Future plans:

- Generate video of iterations
- use different shapes for cells rather than squares
- playing with time ;)
